In today's GIS world the lines between geographer and web developer are blurry. I've spent years of school and more years in my young career learning to be a geographer, but very little on web development. This blog will document my experiences learning how to combine geography and web development. Throughout the process I'll lean on others, make mistakes, and probably wish I just stuck with production GIS. At the end of the day I hope this blog helps others as they make the transition from geographer to something more. 

## This blog will include:

* Successes, failures, tips, and pitfalls to avoid.
* My portfolio, eventually...
* Links to helpful websites, tutorials, and resources.
* My thoughts on current events, particularly as they deal with international development and aid. Geography, web development, and international aid are kind of an odd mix, but it's what I do.
